# Summer_Of_Leetcode
## About this project
Coding interview is a hard part of job and internship finding, so that's why I plan to dedicate 1-2 hours on Leetcode/ just to study general Algorithms. This, hopefully, prepares me for my future college course (Boston Universit CS 330), and helps me prepare for technical interviews.
